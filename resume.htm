<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.therapysites.com/" target="_blank">Sites, LLC</a></h3>
Customer Supper/Front End Developer  <span style="float: right;">Dec 2010 - Current</span>
Since graduating with my first B.A. I have been working at <a id="e-209-c" href="http://www.therapysites.com/" target="_blank">TherapySites</a> <span id="e-210-c">providing customer support and custom design work for our in-house CMS. Recently I have been trying to move my way into more of a developer position and I am currently the lead designer on our new set of fully responsive templates.</span>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Responsive Templates</h3>
I am currently in charge of creating new versions of our existing templates in order to make them fully responsive. Previously none of our templates were mobile friendly. Additionally each template had it's own completely unique (usually table-based) HTML structure, which made making custom changes to customer websites inconsistent and difficult. I have rewritten them to all be based off the same table-less HTML structure with the layout/design entirely CSS and JavaScript based. I am also designing them to be flexible enough that we can start releasing entirely new templates using the same HTML structure on a regular basis.
<h3><a href="http://willcodeforfood.io/" target="_blank">Will Code For Food</a></h3>
<a href="http://willcodeforfood.io/" target="_blank">WillCodeForFood.io</a>. My idea for a small job website entirely for internships, apprenticeships and entry-level developer positions. Currently Wordpress based, though I am planning on building a custom solution for it as a learning exercise.
<h3>More Coming Soon!</h3>
Working full time during the day and auditing classes at night hasn't left much time for large, non-academic personal projects. This is something I hope to change over the next few weeks.
